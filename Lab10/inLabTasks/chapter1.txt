Professor Higgins was known for two things: his groundbreaking research on quantum physics and his legendary love for cafeteria pudding. Every Tuesday, like clockwork, he’d abandon his Nobel Prize-worthy equations to sprint toward the last cup of chocolate pudding before undergrads could swipe it. But one fateful Tuesday, disaster struck. As he lunged for his prized dessert, his elbow knocked over a freshman’s energy drink, sending a sticky tsunami across his meticulously graded midterms. The papers fluttered to the floor like confetti at a very sad party. Desperate, Higgins grabbed a nearby mop—only to realize it was actually the janitor’s wig. The janitor, unamused, banned him from the cafeteria for a week, forcing Higgins to survive on vending machine granola bars, which he swore were "an affront to science."
