Professor Higgins was known for two things: his groundbreaking research on quantum physics and his legendary love for cafeteria pudding. Every Tuesday, like clockwork, he’d abandon his Nobel Prize-worthy equations to sprint toward the last cup of chocolate pudding before undergrads could swipe it. But one fateful Tuesday, disaster struck. As he lunged for his prized dessert, his elbow knocked over a freshman’s energy drink, sending a sticky tsunami across his meticulously graded midterms. The papers fluttered to the floor like confetti at a very sad party. Desperate, Higgins grabbed a nearby mop—only to realize it was actually the janitor’s wig. The janitor, unamused, banned him from the cafeteria for a week, forcing Higgins to survive on vending machine granola bars, which he swore were "an affront to science."

Meanwhile, across campus, Higgins’ arch-nemesis—Dr. Simmons, the biology professor—had orchestrated the whole fiasco. Jealous of Higgins’ pudding privileges, he’d bribed the freshman with extra credit to "accidentally" place the energy drink in the danger zone. But karma struck when Higgins’ disgruntled teaching assistant, tired of deciphering his pudding-stained grading, leaked the story to the student newspaper. The headline—"Puddinggate: A Tragedy of Sticky Proportions"—went viral. Students staged a protest, demanding pudding justice. The dean, caught between academia and absurdity, declared every Tuesday "Pudding Amnesty Day," with double portions for professors who refrained from mopping with wigs. Higgins got his revenge by replacing Simmons’ lab specimens with Jell-O, proving that in the war of desserts, chaos always wins.
