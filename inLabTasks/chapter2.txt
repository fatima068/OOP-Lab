Meanwhile, across campus, Higgins’ arch-nemesis—Dr. Simmons, the biology professor—had orchestrated the whole fiasco. Jealous of Higgins’ pudding privileges, he’d bribed the freshman with extra credit to "accidentally" place the energy drink in the danger zone. But karma struck when Higgins’ disgruntled teaching assistant, tired of deciphering his pudding-stained grading, leaked the story to the student newspaper. The headline—"Puddinggate: A Tragedy of Sticky Proportions"—went viral. Students staged a protest, demanding pudding justice. The dean, caught between academia and absurdity, declared every Tuesday "Pudding Amnesty Day," with double portions for professors who refrained from mopping with wigs. Higgins got his revenge by replacing Simmons’ lab specimens with Jell-O, proving that in the war of desserts, chaos always wins.
